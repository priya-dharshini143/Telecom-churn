# Telecom-churn
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a telecom churn dataset is a crucial step during an internship project. It involves examining and visualizing the data to understand patterns, trends, and anomalies that can help in identifying factors leading to customer churn. EDA helps in cleaning the data, dealing with missing values, and selecting relevant features for predictive modeling. By analyzing various attributes like customer demographics, usage patterns, and service features, interns can gain insights into which factors most strongly influence churn, guiding further analysis and model development.
